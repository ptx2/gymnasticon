Gymnasticon enables obsolete and/or proprietary exercise bikes to work with Zwift and other training apps. Support for new bikes can be added easily. The diagram below shows an example of how it works with the Flywheel Home Bike.

## Bikes tested

* Flywheel
* Peloton Bike (requires an [additional cable](https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon/pull/12#issuecomment-696345309))
* Schwinn IC4/IC8 aka Bowflex C6
* Keiser M Series Bikes (M3i, M3i-TBT, M3iX)
* LifeFitness IC5 (probably works)

## Apps and devices tested

Any software, bike computer or watch that supports standard Bluetooth LE and ANT+ power meter and cadence sensors should work, including:

* Zwift
* TrainerRoad
* Rouvy
* RGT
* FulGaz
* mPaceline
* Peloton iOS/Android (BLE CSC cadence only)
* Garmin Fenix (requires ANT+ stick)
* Garmin Edge
* Wahoo Elemnt Bolt (requires ANT+ stick)

## Platforms tested

Raspberry Pi Zero W is recommended for best user experience. Any recent Linux or macOS system should be able to run Gymnasticon.

* Raspbian Buster on Raspberry Pi Zero W
* Raspbian Buster on Raspberry Pi 4
* Raspbian Buster on Raspberry Pi 3B+
* macOS 10.14+
* Debian Buster on x86-64

> Note: If using a Bluetooth LE bike (e.g. Flywheel) a Bluetooth LE 4.1+ adapter with multi-role capability is required. All Raspberry Pi devices listed above have this capability but not every BT 4.1+ adapter is guaranteed to have it. Alternatively, two BT 4.0+ adapters can also work: one for the client (to connect to the bike) and one for the server (to receive connections from Zwift or another app).

## Quick Start: Install Gymnasticon SD card image

</p>

This is the easiest way to get up and running on a Raspberry Pi.

Prerequisites:

1. A Raspberry Pi Zero W or Raspberry Pi 4
2. A [compatible](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sd-cards.md) micro-SD card (8GB+)
3. Access to a computer with an SD card slot
4. A program to write SD card images like [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) or `dd(1)`

Steps:

1. Download the latest [Gymnasticon SD card image](https://github.com/ptx2/gymnasticon/releases/latest/download/gymnasticon-raspberrypi.img.xz)
2. Write the image to the SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager or `dd`
3. Optionally add a config file to the SD card (not necessary for Flywheel or Peloton, see below)
4. Insert the SD card in the Raspberry Pi, power it up and wait a minute
5. Start pedaling and Gymnasticon should appear in the Zwift device list

Config file:

If using a bike other than Flywheel or Peloton - create and adapt a `gymnasticon.json` file within the main folder of the SD card. It should end up in the same folder as `bootcode.bin`, `cmdline.txt`, `config.txt`, etc.

The following example configures Gymnasticon to look for a Schwinn IC4 bike and to reduce its power measurement values by 8%:

```
{
  "bike": "ic4",
  "power-scale": 0.92
}
```

The following example configures Gymnasticon to look for a Keiser M series bike:

```
{
  "bike": "keiser"
}
```

See below for additional [configuration options](#CLI-options).

Optional extra steps:

1. Setup [networking and remote access](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) so you can check logs, perform upgrades, and do clean shutdowns, etc.

> Note: It's easiest to leave the Raspberry Pi plugged in once it's set up. Safely shutting it down requires first logging in and halting the system at the command-line with `sudo halt`.

## Troubleshooting

Flywheel bike

* Check that there are fresh batteries in the bike (2x D batteries)
* Check that the bike is calibrated: https://ptx2.net/apps/flytest/

Peloton bike (with passive wiring)

* Note that stats are only broadcast during a class or Just Ride session

## Manual install

Try the Quick Start first. Otherwise read on for how to install Gymnasticon and its dependencies manually.

Dependencies:

* Node.JS 12.16.1+
  * [armv6l](https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/download/release/v12.18.3/) binaries (Raspberry Pi)
  * [x64](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/) binaries

* On Linux (including Raspberry Pi)
  * `sudo apt-get install libudev-dev` (required by node-bluetooth-hci-socket)

> Note: Your user must have permission to access the Bluetooth adapter and advertise services.

Install:

    npm install -g gymnasticon
    gymnasticon

To run as an unprivileged user:

    # this gives cap_net_raw+eip to all node programs not just gymnasticon
    sudo setcap cap_net_raw+eip $(eval readlink -f $(which node))

To run at boot time, restart on exit and to avoid giving `cap_net_raw+eip` to the node binary it is recommended to run under systemd. See the `deploy/gymnasticon.service` from this repository for an example systemd unit file.

    sudo cp gymnasticon.service /etc/systemd/system
    sudo systemctl enable gymnasticon
    sudo systemctl start gymnasticon

To view the output of Gymnasticon running under systemd:

    journalctl -u gymnasticon -f

## CLI options

> Note: The CLI options below can also be used in the config file. `--bike ic4` on
> the command-line is the same as `{"bike":"ic4"}` in the config file.

## HOWTO: Add support for a bike

It should be trivial to add support for other proprietary bikes, so long as
there is a means of getting realtime-ish cadence/power data from them.

1. Implement a bikeclient in src/bikes
2. Add cli options to src/app/cli-options
3. Add function to instantiate the bikeclient with the cli options to src/bikes/index.js
